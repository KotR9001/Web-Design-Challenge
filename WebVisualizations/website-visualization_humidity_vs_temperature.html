            <p class="font3" style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you 
                get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the 
                OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities.
                <br>
                <br>
                The second relationship investigated was that between humidity and latitude. 
                It was assumed that the humidity would increase when getting closer to the equator.
                This assumption did not hold up when looking at all data points together. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Moreover, the correlation was tested for each hemisphere separately, to see if the initial
                assumption would hold up when only looking at a hemisphere individually. The data shows that
                the assumption is also false here as well, with the linear regression equations possessing
                R^2 values of 0.09 for the Northern Hemisphere and 0.10 for the Southern Hemisphere. This would
                suggest that there are other factors that affect humidity much more strongly - these could range
                from proximity to bodies of water to local weather behavior.
