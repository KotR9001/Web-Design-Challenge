            <p class="font3" style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you 
                get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the 
                OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities.
                <br>
                <br>
                The first relationship investigated was that between temperature and latitude. 
                It was assumed that the temperature would get warmer upon getting closer to the equator.
                This assumption was validated as seen by the plot.

                Moreover, the correlation was tested for each hemisphere separately, and the linear regression equations 
                bore that out, with the Northern Hemisphere possessing a negative slope and the Southern Hemisphere 
                possessing a positive slope. The Northern Hemisphere equation also had a R^2 value of 0.81, which 
                validates the strong correlation. The Southern Hemisphere equation only had a R^2 value of 0.24, but it 
                was working with fewer data points and over a shorter range of values, so there was less data available 
                to filter out noise.
