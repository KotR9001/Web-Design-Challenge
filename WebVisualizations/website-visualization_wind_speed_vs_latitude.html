            <p class="font3" style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you 
                get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the 
                OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities.
                <br>
                <br>
                The forth relationship investigated was that between wind speed and latitude. 
                It was assumed that there was no relationship between wind speed and latitude.
                This assumption proved to be true. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Moreover, the correlation was tested for each hemisphere separately, to see if the initial
                assumption would hold up when only looking at a hemisphere individually. The data shows that
                the assumption is also true here as well, with the linear regression equations possessing
                R^2 values of 0.02 for the Northern Hemisphere and 0.05 for the Southern Hemisphere. This is likely
                due to the fact that winds are constantly migrating, which would mean that one shouldn't expect that
                latitude would have a consistent effect on wind speed.
